# Discrete Event Simulation


One Paragraph of project description goes here
A discrete event simulator which simulates an Operating system scheduling processes in First Come Fist Serve (FCFS), or in Round Robin Queue (RR). We keep track of:
  - Arrival Time:       Time at which the process arrives in the ready queue.
  - Completion Time:    Time at which process completes its execution.
  - Burst Time:         Time required by a process for CPU execution.
  - Turn Around Time:   Time Difference between completion time and arrival time.          
     - Turn Around Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time

### Prerequisites

- C89 compiler (GCC or CLang)


### Compilation:

Run the compilation bash script (compile.sh)

  $ bash compile.sh

### Running:

Run the new .out file generated

  $ ./DES.out
